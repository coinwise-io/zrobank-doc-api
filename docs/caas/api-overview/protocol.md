# Protocol

Our API follows the REST (Representational State Transfer) API protocol, based on HTTP, using its methods and status codes to define actions and results.

The client sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and the resource it wants to access.

The server processes the request and returns an HTTP response with a status code indicating whether the operation was successful or not. Depending on the request, the server may also return relevant data in the response in a specific format, such as JSON.
