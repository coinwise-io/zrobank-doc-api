# Environments

We offer two environments for our API: **Sandbox** and **Production**

## Sandbox Environment

The Sandbox Environment is designed for integration testing, experimentation, and development purposes. It allows you to test and validate your integrations without affecting your production systems or data.

## Production Environment

The Production Environment is the live environment where your application interacts with our API in a production-ready manner. It provides stable and secure access to real-time data.

## Contact us

For further information, assistance regarding both environments and pricing details, please contact our support team COLOCAR CONTATO DO SUPORTE
