# Security

Our company's culture revolves around prioritizing security, and we have embraced a security-first approach since our inception. Our security philosophy is guided by three core principles:

### Implementing Layered Defense

We employ a multi-layered defense strategy to safeguard our systems and data against external threats. This includes using firewalls, intrusion detection systems,encryption, and robust authentication mechanisms. By employing multiple layers of security measures, we create a robust barrier against potential attacks.

### Mitigating Human Error

We recognize that humans can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities or make mistakes that compromise security. To address this, we prioritize training and awareness programs to educate our employees about best practices and potential risks. Additionally, we implement controls and processes that minimize the impact of human errors, such as implementing access controls, regular audits, and monitoring systems.

### Preventing Insider Misuse

While we trust our employees, we understand the importance of guarding against insider threats. We strictly control and monitor access privileges to ensure that only authorized individuals have appropriate access to sensitive information. This includes implementing role-based access controls, conducting periodic access reviews, and employing user activity monitoring to detect and prevent any unauthorized or suspicious activities.
