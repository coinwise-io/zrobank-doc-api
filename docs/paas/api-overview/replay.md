# Replay Protection

This functionality allows clients to choose the rule that applies to them so that a request is considered as repeated.
For this purpose, a new optional parameter was created: `x-include-replay-protection-schema`. This parameter is only used in the header of cashout endpoints, that is, when sending PIX and P2P transfers.
<br />

## Protection types

Rules for duplicate cashes out (PIX and P2P) in PaaS API:

  - If the user does not choose any of the rules, **the payload blocking** rule will be used by default;
  - If the user chooses a rule via header, then that rule will be applied to that cashout request;

### Payload blocking (no value on x-include-replay-protection-schema parameter)

  - If the user repeats the payload, regardless of whether or not they changed  nonce and transaction UUID values, new requests will be blocked for 2 hours;
  - If the user does not repeat the payload, regardless of whether or not the nonce and transaction UUID values has been changed, new requests won't be blocked;

### Nonce blocking (`nonce` value on x-include-replay-protection-schema parameter)

  - If the user repeats the nonce and payload in the request, it will be blocked for 2 hours;
  - If the user changes the nonce and/or payload, it won't be blocked;

### Transaction UUID blocking (`x-transaction-uuid` value on x-include-replay-protection-schema parameter)

  - If the user repeats the transaction UUID and payload in the request, it will be blocked for 2 hours;
  - If the user changes the transaction UUID and/or payload, it won't be blocked;

### Nonce & Transaction UUID blocking (`nonce&x-transaction-uuid` value on x-include-replay-protection-schema parameter)

  - If the user repeats the transaction uuid, nonce and payload, it will be blocked for 2 hours;
  - If the user changes the transaction uuid and/or nonce and/or payload, it won't be blocked;


:::note
This new header type is optional. If not defined, the **payload blocking** will be considered.
