# Protocol

Our system uses the HTTPS protocol for all gateway actions, allowing you to easily communicate with our API using standard HTTPS requests.

When communicating with our API, you should use the appropriate HTTPS method based on the action you wish to perform. For example, you should use GET requests to retrieve data, POST requests to create new resources, PUT and PATCH requests to update existing resources, and DELETE requests to remove resources.

All requests and responses are sent in JSON format, ensuring that data is transmitted efficiently and effectively. Additionally, we use the HTTPS protocol to ensure that all data transmitted between your system and ours is encrypted and secure.
